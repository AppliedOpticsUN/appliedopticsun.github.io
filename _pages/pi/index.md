UNBOS is an outreach group created in 2008 by physics students in order to bring science closer to the largest number of people regardless of their condition. We carry out interactive activities in schools, universities, and other scenarios, always seeking to encourage curiosity and interest that characterize scientific thinking.

We are a non-profit group with two international sponsors: OPTICA (formerly the Optical Society of America) and SPIE (International Society for Optics and Photonics). These sponsors provide financial and logistical support, necessary to make our activities a reality. By being a student member of these organizations, you can access the main optics magazines internationally, as well as participate in events for academic and professional growth, in contact with experts from all over the world.
