    Dr. Morin is in the department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at SFU and BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre.
    He earned MSc and PhD in bioinformatics from UBC in the laboratory of Marco Marra.
    Dr. Morin's early research involved the use of massively parallel sequencing to identify driver mutations in leukemias and lymphomas including histone modifiers such as EZH2 and KMT2D.
    His current research focus involves using genome and transcriptome sequencing to discover novel drivers in B-cell lymphomas and to determine mechanisms that underlie tumour progression and treatment resistance. 
    Morin has an interest in developing methods to identify non-coding mutations with regulatory potential from genome-wide data sets and algorithms to identify mutations and copy number from circulating tumour DNA.

    Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly becoming adopted as a sensitive biomarker for non-invasive monitoring of treatment response in many cancer types.
    Stephen's work helped to establish and validate numerous assays for quantifying ctDNA in plasma from lymphoma patients.
    These assays demonstrated prognostic utility of ctDNA in multiple clinical trials.

    Lymphoma is the most common cancer affecting pet dogs. Kevin used genomic techniques to identify mutations involved in lymphomagenesis in canine B-cell lymphoma.
    His work identified TRAF3 as one of the most commonly mutated genes in this cancer. He also studied the potential utility of ctDNA in a variety of human cancers.
    He joined our laboratory full-time after graduating and has since started law school.

    Arezoo generated and analyzed exome sequence data from DLBCL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumours.
    Her thesis project involved a meta-analysis of published and in-house exome data to identify new recurrently-mutated genes in MCL including a novel silent mutation hot spot in MAP3K14.

    In the beginning back in nineteen fifty five man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show
    And all that jive the white man had the schmaltz the black man had the blues, no one knew what they was gonna do
    But Tchaikovsky had the news he said let there be sound, there was sound. Let there be light, there was light
    Let there be drums, there was drums
    Let there be guitar, there was guitar. Let there be rock

    There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
    When she gets there she knows If the stores are all closed with a word she can get what she came for.
    And she's buying a stairway to heaven. There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure, cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
    In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving.

    I know you don't get chance to take a break this often. I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
    You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the sweat, sweat, sweat.
