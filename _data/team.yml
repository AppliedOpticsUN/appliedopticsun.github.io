    Full professor at the  <a href="https://ciencias.bogota.unal.edu.co/departamentos/fisica/inicio">Department of Physics of UNAL</a>.
    I obtained the degree of Physicist in 1991 with the thesis -Design and fabrication of metallic and dielectric thin films with applications in optics- 
    and the degree of Master in Physics in 1995 with the thesis -Reconstruction of one-dimensional gratings based on the Autocorrelation Theorem. 
    Application to small displacements recorded by the double exposure method-, at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. 
    In 2001, I was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science - Optics at the Centro de Investigaciones en Optica - Mexico, with the thesis 
    -Design and construction of a corneal topographer based on the Hartmann test-.
    I am currently working on the design of optical instruments and interference phenomena.

    PhD in Photonics - Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, 2014.  
    I  am a physicist and an optical scientist with ample experience in the development of advanced optical instrumentation for studying complex biophysical phenomena: 
    from deep imaging of biological tissues and laser-manipulation of small organisms to ultrafast calcium imaging of neuronal networks. I am currently interested in the 
    development of cost-effective high-resolution microscopy devices, novel computational microscopy methods and biophotonics.
