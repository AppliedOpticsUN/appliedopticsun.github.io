    Dr. Morin is in the department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at 
    SFU and BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre.
    He earned MSc and PhD in bioinformatics from UBC in the laboratory of 
    Marco Marra.
    Dr. Morin's early research involved the use of massively parallel 
    sequencing to identify driver mutations in leukemias and lymphomas 
    including histone modifiers such as EZH2 and KMT2D.
    His current research focus involves using genome and transcriptome 
    sequencing to discover novel drivers in B-cell lymphomas and to 
    determine mechanisms that underlie tumour progression and treatment 
    resistance. 
    Morin has an interest in developing methods to identify non-coding 
    mutations with regulatory potential from genome-wide data sets and 
    algorithms to identify mutations and copy number from circulating 
    tumour DNA.

    Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly becoming adopted as a 
    sensitive biomarker for non-invasive monitoring of treatment response 
    in many cancer types.
    Stephen's work helped to establish and validate numerous assays for 
    quantifying ctDNA in plasma from lymphoma patients.
    These assays demonstrated prognostic utility of ctDNA in multiple 
    clinical trials.

    Lymphoma is the most common cancer affecting pet dogs. Kevin used 
    genomic techniques to identify mutations involved in lymphomagenesis 
    in canine B-cell lymphoma.
    His work identified TRAF3 as one of the most commonly mutated genes 
    in this cancer. He also studied the potential utility of ctDNA in a 
    variety of human cancers.
    He joined our laboratory full-time after graduating and has since 
    started law school.

    Arezoo generated and analyzed exome sequence data from DLBCL and 
    mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumours.
    Her thesis project involved a meta-analysis of published and in-house 
    exome data to identify new recurrently-mutated genes in MCL including 
    a novel silent mutation hot spot in MAP3K14.

    My main role at the Morin lab focuses on the development and 
    implementation of assays with potential utility in the genetic 
    stratification, non-invasive monitoring and management of cancer 
    patients. 
    We have developed assays relying on targeted hybridization capture 
    followed by high throughput sequencing as well as assays relying on 
    droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). 
    I am particularly interested in the development and optimization of 
    molecular techinques for the ultrasensitive and straightforward 
    detection of tumour-derived DNA fragments. 
    Detection and quantification of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) via 
    duplex sequencing with semi-degenerate barcoded adapters and the use 
    of wild-type specific hydrolysis probes (“inverted” ddPCR) to detect 
    multiple recurrent somatic mutations of clinical relevance are 
    amongst my main contributions into this growing area of research.
    Currently, I am involved in different projects related to the genetic 
    characterization of different types of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and the 
    detection, quantification and serial monitoring of ctDNA in cancer 
    patients, including those enrolled in the personalized oncogenomics 
    project (POG). We are also starting to apply our error-correction 
    duplex sequencing approach for the sequencing of ancient DNA, 
    including archaeological specimens of both pacific salmons and 
    woolly dogs.

    My project in the lab is focused on the characterization of novel 
    NFKBIZ 3’ UTR mutations we previously discovered in DLBCL. 
    These mutations were discovered through a project searching for 
    genome-wide non-coding mutations and found to be significantly 
    enriched in the ABC sub-type of DLBCL. 
    My research involves functional analysis of these mutations in 
    DLBCL cell lines and in vivo mouse xenograft models to determine 
    how these mutations lead to activation of the NF-kB pathway and 
    contribute to DLBCL. 
    I am also working to determine the structure of the NFKBIZ 3’ UTR 
    and how mutations lead to changes that affect the regulation of 
    this gene.

  position: PhD Student
  bio: >
    As the first bioinformatics graduate student in the lab, I've played 
    a role in several projects, each involving cancer genomics to some 
    degree.
    Currently, my primary project is the genetic and molecular 
    characterization of paediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL).
    Defined by an epidemiological association with the Epstein–Barr virus
    and malaria, the endemic variant of BL has been understudied compared
    to sporadic BL, which is diagnosed in developed countries.
    I lead the analysis of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing data 
    derived from over 100 cases, which has led to breakthroughs in our 
    understanding of BL pathogenesis.
    On the side, I'm an advocate for open and reproducible science, a
    Software Carpentry instructor teaching programming to researchers, 
    and the co-founder of the Scientific Programming Study Group at SFU 
    (SciProg.ca) and the annual Hackseq genomics hackathon.

    My current research goal is to identify genetic features that 
    underlie elevated expression and somatic amplification of the FCGR2B 
    gene as a driver of treatment resistance. 
    Because Fcy receptor IIB promotes the internalization of rituximab, 
    a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of most non-Hodgkin 
    lymphomas, patients with high FCGR2B expression experience inferior 
    outcomes relative to patients with low FCGR2B expression. 
    My project involves both wet and dry lab components, using analysis 
    of RNAseq and whole genome and exome sequencing data to identify 
    candidate drivers of FCGR2B expression, and functionally 
    characterizing these candidates in cell lines.

    Recent studies have identified a handful of genetic subgroups which 
    present a novel method of classification for alternative treatment 
    strategies. 
    For my thesis project, I aim to expand on classifying these subgroups 
    in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma using a machine learning approach 
    utilizing molecular indicators such as mutation status from a set 
    of genes and hot spots relevant to the cancer type, copy number 
    segmentation, and identification, cell-of-origin, as features. 
    I hope to consolidate subtypes from these studies as well as to 
    capture novel groups to capture an aspect of pathogenic 
    heterogeneity of DLBCL.

    I am a statistician and a bioinformatician at times.
    Although I had several years' experience in a molecular biology lab 
    and did tissue/cell culture, DNA and RNA isolation, real-time PCR, 
    quantitative and qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), 
    cloning, western blots, southern blots, yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assay, 
    microarray, even manually sequencing and so on; 
    I have been focusing on statistical analysis since 2002. 

    My daily work involves data analysis, statistical consulting, and of 
    course statistical programming. 
    My research interesting, however, is to develop customized statistical 
    algorithms to solve biological researches problems, especially for 
    high dimensional data. 
    My recent researches are to identify mutation peaks/ranges and build
    up new classification models that can be transformed to different 
    data sets and even different platforms.
