    Dr. Morin is in the department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at 
    SFU and BC Cancer's Genome Sciences Centre.
    He earned MSc and PhD in bioinformatics from UBC in the laboratory of 
    Marco Marra.
    Dr. Morin's early research involved the use of massively parallel 
    sequencing to identify driver mutations in leukemias and lymphomas 
    including histone modifiers such as EZH2 and KMT2D.
    His current research focus involves using genome and transcriptome 
    sequencing to discover novel drivers in B-cell lymphomas and to 
    determine mechanisms that underlie tumour progression and treatment 
    resistance. 
    Morin has an interest in developing methods to identify non-coding 
    mutations with regulatory potential from genome-wide data sets and 
    algorithms to identify mutations and copy number from circulating 
    tumour DNA.

    Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly becoming adopted as a 
    sensitive biomarker for non-invasive monitoring of treatment response 
    in many cancer types.
    Stephen's work helped to establish and validate numerous assays for 
    quantifying ctDNA in plasma from lymphoma patients.
    These assays demonstrated prognostic utility of ctDNA in multiple 
    clinical trials.

    Lymphoma is the most common cancer affecting pet dogs. Kevin used 
    genomic techniques to identify mutations involved in lymphomagenesis 
    in canine B-cell lymphoma.
    His work identified TRAF3 as one of the most commonly mutated genes 
    in this cancer. He also studied the potential utility of ctDNA in a 
    variety of human cancers.
    He joined our laboratory full-time after graduating and has since 
    started law school.

    Arezoo generated and analyzed exome sequence data from DLBCL and 
    mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumours.
    Her thesis project involved a meta-analysis of published and in-house 
    exome data to identify new recurrently-mutated genes in MCL including 
    a novel silent mutation hot spot in MAP3K14.

    My main role at the Morin lab focuses on the development and 
    implementation of assays with potential utility in the genetic 
    stratification, non-invasive monitoring and management of cancer 
    patients. 
    We have developed assays relying on targeted hybridization capture 
    followed by high throughput sequencing as well as assays relying on 
    droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). 
    I am particularly interested in the development and optimization of 
    molecular techinques for the ultrasensitive and straightforward 
    detection of tumour-derived DNA fragments. 
    Detection and quantification of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) via 
    duplex sequencing with semi-degenerate barcoded adapters and the use 
    of wild-type specific hydrolysis probes (“inverted” ddPCR) to detect 
    multiple recurrent somatic mutations of clinical relevance are 
    amongst my main contributions into this growing area of research.
    Currently, I am involved in different projects related to the genetic 
    characterization of different types of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and the 
    detection, quantification and serial monitoring of ctDNA in cancer 
    patients, including those enrolled in the personalized oncogenomics 
    project (POG). We are also starting to apply our error-correction 
    duplex sequencing approach for the sequencing of ancient DNA, 
    including archaeological specimens of both pacific salmons and 
    woolly dogs.
