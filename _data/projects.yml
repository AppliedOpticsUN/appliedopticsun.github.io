- name: Genetic and molecular mechanisms of treatment resistance in DLBCL
  description: >
    Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent the sixth most commonly diagnosed 
    type of cancer in Canada with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most prevalent. 
    DLBCL patients exhibit variable responses to available therapies such 
    as R-CHOP. Some biomarkers beginning to enter clinical trials rely on 
    gene expression signatures to identify high-risk cases.
    For example, DLBCL comprises two cell-of-origin (COO) subgroups with 
    activated B-cell (ABC) cases typically having worse prognosis than 
    germinal centre B-cell (GCB) cases.
    Therapeutics that exploit molecular features unique to each subgroup 
    are being actively pursued but up-front identification of patients 
    unlikely to achieve a durable response remains a challenge.
    Although existing methods can identify specific prognostic gene 
    expression features, these capture only some of the clinical 
    heterogeneity and require tumour RNA, which is not always available. 
    Using comprehensive genomic analyses and by integrating mutation and 
    expression data from over 2000 DLBCL tumours, we seek novel molecular 
    features that are associated with treatment resistance in DLBCL.
    The ultimate goal of this work is to develop new predictive and 
    prognostic biomarkers and identify new therapeutic targets for 
    treatment-resistant DLBCLs.

- name: Comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)
  description: >
    Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare cancer that derives from B lymphocytes in the periphery (mantle zone)
    of the germinal centre. MCL is most often diagnosed at stage 3 or 4 and is typically aggressive although some patients have an indolent form of the disesae.
    Only 30-40% of patients with advanced disease achieving a complete response to frontline treatments (R-bendamustine).
    Heterogeneous clinical response is partially attributable to observable variations in morphology, immunophenotype and proliferative capacity;
    however, there is little known about the relationship between genetic features and variation in phenotype or response to specific treatment regimens.
    Through a meta-analysis of in-house and existing exome sequencing data, our group has identified multiple novel driver mutations in MCL including some that associate with high or low proliferation. 
    To more completely ascertain the mutations that lead to lymphomagenesis in MCL, we are performing an integrative proteogenomic characterization of MCL tumours using a combination of whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq and shotgun proteomics. 
    We will are using these data to identify novel coding and non-coding (i.e. regulatory) driver mutations that affect the natural history of MCL including treatment response.

- name: Identification and functional characterization of recurrent non-coding mutations in NHLs
  description: >
       The list of protein-coding drivers identified through sequencing in DLBCL
       has begun to saturate and yet there remains a gap in our understanding 
       of how these genetic alterations contribute to the 
       transcriptional differences underlying known prognostic signatures and molecular subgroups.
       For example, dysregulation of NF-κB is the hallmark feature of ABC 
       DLBCL but many ABC cases appear to lack the common driver mutations 
       that are known to promote NF-κB. We are seeking driver mutations 
       that contribute to some features of NHLs.
       We use data-driven comprehnsive methods that allow identification of 
       non-coding SSMs with a regulatory effect in cis or trans on 
       genes/proteins relevant to malignancy.

- name: Comprehensive characterization of endemic and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma
  description: >
    Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is currently classified as one of three clinical 
    variants: endemic BL, sporadic BL, and HIV-associated BL.
    The endemic variant is primarily diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa and is 
    epidemiologically associated with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and 
    malaria infection; although, the role of these pathogens in promoting 
    the formation of BL remains unclear.
    On the other hand, sporadic BL is diagnosed outside of malaria-endemic
    areas, with only a minority of cases being EBV-positive (10-30%).
    This project seeks to generate high-throughput whole genome and 
    transcriptome sequencing data from over 100 BL tumours in order to
    elucidate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of the disease.
    With this project, we aim to refine the mutational landscape of BL to 
    facilitate the development of less toxic targeted therapies. 
    We also plan on investigating the oncogenic role of EBV and whether it may
    serve as a better criterion for disease classification than the current
    system relying on geographic origin.
