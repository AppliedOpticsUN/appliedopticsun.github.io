- name: Design of a commercial prototype of a lensometer
  description: >
    The idea of the project is to build the software and hardware required in order to get a usefull lensometer capable of
    analice traditional and also progressive addition ophthalmic lenses, this analysis give us the sphere and cylinder power maps
    via Fourier analisis and a rectangular-Hartmann screen. With this information we can know how are the diopters over the lenses
    and the shape of the progressive corridor.
