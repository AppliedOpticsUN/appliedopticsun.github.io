- name: Genetic and molecular mechanisms of treatment resistance in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
  description: >
    Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) represent the sixth most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in Canada with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most prevalent. 
    DLBCL patients exhibit variable responses to available therapies such as R-CHOP. Some biomarkers beginning to enter clinical trials rely on gene expression signatures to identify high-risk cases.
     For example, DLBCL comprises two cell-of-origin (COO) subgroups with activated B-cell (ABC) cases typically having worse prognosis than germinal centre B-cell (GCB) cases.
     Therapeutics that exploit molecular features unique to each subgroup are being actively pursued but up-front identification of patients unlikely to achieve a durable response remains a challenge.
     Although existing methods can identify specific prognostic gene expression features, these capture only some of the clinical heterogeneity and require tumour RNA, which is not always available. 
     Using comprehensive genomic analyses and by integrating mutation and expression data from over 2000 DLBCL tumours, we seek novel molecular features that are associated with treatment resistance in DLBCL.
     The ultimate goal of this work is to develop new predictive and prognostic biomarkers and identify new therapeutic targets for treatment-resistant DLBCLs.

- name: Identification and functional characterization of recurrent non-coding mutations in non-Hodgkin lymphomas
  description: >
       The list of protein-coding drivers identified through sequencing has begun to saturate and yet there remains a gap in our understanding of how these or additional genetic alterations contribute to the transcriptional differences underlying known prognostic signatures.
       For example, dysregulation of NF-κB is the hallmark feature of ABC DLBCL but many ABC cases appear to lack the common driver mutations that are known to promote NF-κB. We are seeking driver mutations that contribute to some features of NHLs.
       We use data-driven comprehnsive methods that allow identification of non-coding SSMs with a regulatory effect in cis or trans on genes/proteins relevant to malignancy.
